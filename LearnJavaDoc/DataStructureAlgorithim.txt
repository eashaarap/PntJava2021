Arrays:
   - data structure that allows you to store multiple

   2D Array/ Multimensional Array: simple words as array of arrays

   Data in 2D array are stored in tabular form(in row major order)

ARRAY LIST
-Implements List Interface
-Always maintains insertion order
-Stores value or element
-can contain duplicate elements
-can have any numbers of null elements in Arraylist
-Arraylist get() method always gives us 0(1) performance

*****ArrayList Vs Linked List*****
-Manipulation with ArrayList is slow because it internally uses an array.
If any element is removed from the array, all the bits are shifted in memory
-Manipulation with LinkedList is faster because bit uses a doubly linked list,
so not bit shift is required in memory.

An arrayList class can act as a list only because it implements List only
LinkedList class can act as a list and queue both because it implements List and Deque interfaces

ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data
LinkedList is better for manipulating data

MAP:
Few characteristics of the Map Interface are:

A Map cant contain duplicate keys and each key can map to at most one value
Some implementations allow null key and null value like the HashMap and linkedHashmap,
but some dont like the TreeMap.

The order of a ap depends on specific implementations,
e.g. TreeMap and LinkedHashMap have predictable order, while HashMap does not.
There are two interfaces for implementing Map in java: Map and SortedMap,
and three classes: HashMap, TreeMap, and LinkedHashMap

    HASHMAP:
        The java HashMap is implements Map interface
        Doesn't maintain the insertion order
        Stores key and value pairs
        doesn't containing duplicate keys but contain duplicate values
        We can have only one null key and any number of null values in HashMap
